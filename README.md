# **Liver Disease Prediction and Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
This is the README file for the Liver Disease Prediction and Detection Project, I have built a system for Predicting the best algorithm to identify the person affected with liver disease and Detecting wheather the person is affected with Liver Disease or not. This README provides and overview of the project,its objectives,data preprocessing,exploratory data analysis,model evaluation and visualization.

## **Problem Statement**
This data set contains 584 liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains male patient records and female patient records.
