**Project Overview**
  Liver Disease Prediction and Detection System aims to Predict the best algorithm for liver disease patient and also detects wheather a person is affected with liver disease or not.This project's objective include data preprocessing,exploratory data analysis,model evaluation and the use of visualizations to enhance our understanding of the data and model performance.

  **Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring the quality and relevance of the data for analysis. Key preprocessing steps include:
 * Handling missing values in the dataset.
